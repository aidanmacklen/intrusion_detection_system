# intrusion_detection_system
This python script uses 'scapy' in finding high traffic from an IP address, possibly being a possible DDoS condition. For the sake of better reading, we will be using "high traffic" to refer to a number of received packets from a same IP address, exceeding some threshold value within a fixed time window.
